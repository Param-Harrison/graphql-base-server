- [ ] File locations reference should follow proper pattern
- [ ] ORM config can be made through JS / TS (for reusing variables from docker-compose)
- [ ] Production build process
- [ ] Circle CI integrations with github
- [ ] Forget password doesn't send a email yet (front end URL not passed well in context)
